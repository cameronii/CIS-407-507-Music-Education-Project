# CIS-407-507-Music-Education-Project
Music Education Game made with Pygame

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project Description
The project will be a python application used to help teach music students basic concepts of rhythm, pitch, and melody. The application will include several different activities. One will be an activity where a student listens to a sequence of beats and tries to input the same rhythm. Another activity will play a note for a student and they will have to match the pitch by inputting the same note that they heard. These activities will have a scoring function to give feedback to the users on how well they performed. The application will also include a free-play aspect where users can compose their own melodies by inputting a sequence of notes and record and play the sequences back. An additional feature we may add if the main deliverables are completed is a function for users to have an account that keeps track of their scores and shows their progress over time.

The target demographic of our user base is younger and beginning music students. The activities in our application are useful for users at any level of music competency, but are likely more useful for students who are only starting to learn the basics.

We plan to use GitHub for source control and meet once a week in person or on zoom to talk about progress, setbacks, issues, etc.

Progress Goals

-Mid-Term Goal
By the mid-term milestone we hope to have the activities coded and functioning separately from one another.

-End of Term Goal
By the end of the term we hope to have the full python application built and looking good with a GUI implemented. We will also try to complete as many additional features as possible, time permitting.

We will also convert what we have completed into an executable file so that the application can be easily used by teachers and students without any knowledge of python.
